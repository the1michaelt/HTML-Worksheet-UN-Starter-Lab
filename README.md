# HTML-Worksheet_UN_Starter_Lab

Notes
This project will have you open an html file in both your browser and in VS Code. You will read through the sections in the browser and switch to the code in VS Code when prompted to examine the HTML or add new content. When it is finished, you will have had hands-on time with many of the major concepts of building websites using HTML, and the document itself will be a hand resource you can come back to for reminders!
The styling on the page is very minimal to emphasize the content and show what can be done purely with HTML and no CSS.
